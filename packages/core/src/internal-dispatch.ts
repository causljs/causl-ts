 * entrypoint (in `internal.ts`). The bridge keeps adapter primitives
 * (e.g., `dispose`) callable from outside the engine without leaking
 * them onto the public {@link Graph} interface in `types.ts`.
 *
 * @remarks
 * Application code does not import this file (it is not in the
 * package's `exports`). The shape lives here, separate from
 * `internal.ts`, so the engine can register dispatch entries without
 * pulling in the public-but-internal entrypoint module. Like every
 * surface behind `@causl/core/internal`, this module is excluded
 * from the public-method commitment and carries no SemVer guarantee.
